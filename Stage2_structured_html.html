    <h2>Lessson 1: Basics of the Web</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>The Web works</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The web consists of mutiple servers/computers that communicate with each other. When doing a search on your computer browser sends a <em> <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/H/HTTP.html">HTTP</a></em> request to a server, That server locates the <em> HTML </em> doc and then the users browser interprets the page and displays it on your computer. Hyper links glue everything together.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>HTML</b>
     </p>
     <p>
       The main type of document on the web is a HTML doc. HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language.</em> This doc contains <b>text content which shows what you see<b> and </b>markup which 

shows how it looks</b>.
     </p>
   </div>
   <div>
     <p>
       <b>Tag and Elements</b>
     </p>
     <p>
       HTML documents are made of HTML elements. HTML writing tells the type of each element by using <em> HTML </em> tags.
     </p>
   </div>
   <div>
     <p>
       <b> Inline or Block Elemets</b>
     </p>
     <p>
       HTML elements are inline or block. Block elements have an invisible box around its content.
     </p>
   </div>
 </div>
    <h2>Lesson 2: Adding structure to HTML</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Adding structure to HTML
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.
        Block elements form an "invisible box" around the
        content inside of them.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>The "tree-like structure" of HTML</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
        elements can have other elements inside of them. You can
        draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had
        multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
        <br>
        In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of
        nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of
        boxes, and so on...
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave
        of changing indentations going up and down the left side
        of the document. The more indented an element is, the more
        deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Text Editors (for programming)</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like
        Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's
        life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically
        generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Lesson 3: Adding CSS style</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        <em>CSS is code written to control the style of HTML elememts.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS stands for Color Style Sheets
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>CSS controls HTML</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        With CSS you can control font style properties,colors, margins and borders.
